## Furniture store based on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/2hehowUjuV8cspZeIhFnlz/eCommerce-Website-%7C-Web-Page-Design-%7C-UI-KIT-%7C-Interior-Landing-Page-(Community)?node-id=117-336&node-type=frame&t=NOsePgs0s6q3t90U-0) and [Live demo](https://furniture-store-theta-two.vercel.app/)

This project is a simple web application built with [Next.js 15](https://nextjs.org/) along with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/). The goal of this project is to provide a starter template for developing modern, responsive websites using the latest features of Next.js.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
